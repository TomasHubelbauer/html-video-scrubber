    <h1>HTML <code>video</code> Scrubbar</h1>
    <p>
      This experiment explores how a video player scrubbar would look like if it
      didn't contain full frames one next to another to fill the available space
      with as many full frames as possible, but instead if each unit of resolution
      of the available space was painted with a slice through the middle of the
      video at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would the parts of the video be recognizable? Would it help see cuts and
      landmarks better? Would it be preferrable to the status quo? You decide.

    <h2>Generate scrubbar by seeking with sliding</h2>
    <p>
      This is the same as the method below but instead of always taking the middle
      slice from the frame, it takes a slice where if the scrubbar was filled with
      frames side by side, the current position intersects the frame at some ratio
      of its width and that same ratio of its width is used to take the slice in
      the source video frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      This provides much better results in static scenes and no worse results in
      dynamic ones.

    <h2>Generate scrubbar by seeking</h2>
    <p>
      This method seeks the video at times corresponding with each unit of resolution
      of the available scrubbar space. It looks like a very jittery playback and
      the spinner is blinking throughout of the generation process, so it is not
      very suitable, but is the most efficient (each unit is generated once).

    <h2>Generate scrubbar as playing with sliding</h2>
    <p>
      This is the same principle as the seeking sliding version with the same
      benefit of the playing version (not hijacking the playback position), but
      also the same drawback (gaps in continuous playback and taking longer to
      generate).

    <h2>Generate scrubbar as playing</h2>
    <p>
      This method makes use of the <code>timeupdate</code> event of a playing
      video. It is real-time (so potentially slower than the seeking method) and
      is dependent on the playback state of the video, but makes for a more
      useful user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid gaps caused by potentially low time update event firing frequency,
      several units are painted each time to ensure to cover the gaps in case of
      a real time playback even if the update frequency is low.
