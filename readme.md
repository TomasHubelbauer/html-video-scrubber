# HTML `video` Scrubber

This repository contains and experimental HTML `video` scrubbar implementation
which instead of placing video frames one by one until the scrubbar runs out of
place slices the video into unit-sizes places and fill the scrubbar with the
finest resolution possible preview.

The quest here is to explore how this looks, how useful or not it is and how
helpful it might potentially be for viewing and editing user scenarios.
